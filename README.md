# ConfFedProto: Adaptive Confidence Based Prototype Aggregation for Federated Prototype Learning on Non-IID Data

This repository implements ConFedProto, a novel federated learning approach that uses prototype learning to handle heterogeneous clients.

## Overview

confFedProto addresses heterogeneity in federated learning by exchanging prototypes instead of model parameters. This approach helps in:
- Handling non-IID data distributions
- Reducing communication costs
- Improving model performance
