# ConfFedProto: Adaptive Confidence Based Prototype Aggregation for Federated Learning

This repository implements ConfFedProto, an extension of FedProto that introduces adaptive confidence-based prototype aggregation to better handle heterogeneous clients. The implementation supports both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

## Overview

ConfFedProto extends the FedProto approach by adding confidence-based prototype aggregation. This enhanced approach helps in:
- Handling non-IID data distributions
- Reducing communication costs
- Improving model performance through adaptive confidence mechanisms
- Supporting heterogeneous client environments
